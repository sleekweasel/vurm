<h3><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>This page follows on from <a href="http://www.lesession.co.uk/pf/abc_notation.htm">my introductory
tutorial to the abc music notation system</a>. The introductory tutorial, which starts from the
absolute basics of abc and works through to being able to notate
a simple melody, can be found be <a href="http://www.lesession.co.uk/pf/abc_notation.htm">clicking on this link</a>.</p>

<p>This second part of the tutorial assumes
you are familiar with the basics of abc notation which are
explained in the introductory tutorial, and extends the tutorial
to cover other aspects of the notation standard. Some of this
second tutorial is therefore, I readily admit, little more than a
paraphrasing of the abc standard available on the abc homepage,
although I hope I have added some extra value through added
explanation or expansion.</p>

<p>This tutorial explains the abc music
notation language as at version 1.6, which is the current version
at the time of writing (July 2001). </p>

<p>At a couple of points in this tutorial,
there are hyperlinks to a page detailing proposed extensions of
the language. If you are reading this tutorial wishing only
to understand how abc is written <b>now</b>,
you can choose to ignore these links to proposed extensions and
your abc notation will be perfectly correct. Features described in these linked sections
are NOT an agreed part of the abc notation standard, but are proposed
extensions to that standard that may in the future be adopted as
a part of the standard. Features described there may have been implemented in
some abc software packages, but the syntax or format of a feature detailed there may change before
the feature is adopted as a part of the full abc specification, and the
feature may not be understood by other users or supported by their particular
choice of abc software </p>

<p>For further information on abc, the various
software packages available, and links to other abc sites and
tune collections, go to the abc home page at <a href="http://www.abcnotation.org.uk/" target="new">http://www.abcnotation.org.uk</a>.</p>

<p>I would of course be extremely indebted to anyone who points out any errors
  of fact or interpretation in this tutorial: my email address is available <a href="http://www.lesession.co.uk/email.htm">here</a>.
</p>

<p>Still here? Good : off we go then ....</p>

<h2>Elements in the tune body</h2>

<h3><a name="grace"></a>Ornaments and grace
notes</h3>

<p>The general symbol for an ornament is the
tilde ~.</p>

<p>The symbol is placed before the note to be
ornamented, eg</p>

<p>~G2</p>

<p>Note that the tilde is a general mark to indicated the presence of an ornament,
  and does not specify a particular ornamentation - it is usually interpreted
  as a roll or a turn. For the more precise notation of ornamentation such as
  Great Highland Bagpipe music, and for the notation of particular grace notes,
  enclose the notes in curly brackets { } eg</p>

<p>{GAGDG}G2</p>

<p>The notes within curly brackets have no fixed time value, so their length cannot
  be modified by use of the usual symbols : in other words anything like {G2AG2D},
  {GA/G/D/G}, or {GA&gt;GD&gt;G} is out of the question. The pitch of the notes
  is notated in the usual way, eg the octave modifiers , and ' are useable.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lesession.co.uk/pf/abc_notation_part2.htm#top">Back to the top of the
page</a></p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="beams"></a>Slurs and Ties</h3>

<p>The minus sign - should be used to tie two
notes of equal pitch, whilst the round brackets () join two or
more notes which are to be slurred, or played <em>legato</em>.</p>

<p>Two notes can be tied together with a minus
sign - . This can be applied both within a bar and across bar
lines, eg</p>

<p>|DEF-|FGA|</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>|DEF-FGA|</p>

<p>are both correct. The tie marking should be
placed immediately after a note, but can be <em>followed</em> by
a space.</p>

<p>To slur a group of notes or join them together as a phrase , use round
brackets ( ) to enclose the grouped notes, eg</p>

<p>(DEF|GAB)</p>

<p>Spaces can be used within the slur to
improve the legibility of the file. However the first and last
notes, (including any pitch and/or length markings) should be
placed hard up against the beginning and ending brackets. So</p>

<p>(^G A B/c/|E4 D4)</p>

<p>is correct, but ( ^G A B/c/|E4 D4 ) is well
wide of the mark.</p>

<p>It's also worth mentioning that you can 'nest' slurs inside
each other, so that a passage of music finishing with a
tied note can be shown either as </p>

<p>(D E F (G | G4))</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>(D E F G-| G4) </p>
<p> are both understood. </p>

page</a></p>

<h3><a name="ets"></a>Triplets, quadruplets,
and the various other tuplets</h3>

<p>The basic notation for duplets, triplets,
quadruplets etc. is straightforward : an opening round bracket,
the number, and the notes within the tuplet eg</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="2">
    <tbody><tr>
        <td>Duplet</td>
        <td>(2GA</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Triplet</td>
        <td>(3GAB</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Quadruplet</td>
        <td>(4GABA</td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>and so on, up to</p>

<p>(9GABcdcBAG</p>

<p>Note that there are no spaces in the
tuplet.</p>

<p>The values of the particular tuplets are
(to quote the abc specification)</p>

<table border="1">
    <tbody><tr>
        <td>(2</td>
        <td>2 notes in the time of 3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>(3</td>
        <td>3 notes in the time of 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>(4</td>
        <td>4 notes in the time of 3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>(5</td>
        <td>5 notes in the time of <em>n</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>(6</td>
        <td>6 notes in the time of 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>(7</td>
        <td>7 notes in the time of <em>n</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>(8</td>
        <td>8 notes in the time of 3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>(9</td>
        <td>9 notes in the time of <em>n</em></td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><em>n</em> is 3 in compound time signatures
(3/4, 3/8, 9/8 etc), and 2 in simple time signatures (C, 4/4, 2/4
etc.)</p>

<p><b>Warning</b> : this next section is not as bad as it first
looks. There are however some people - me for example - who are
allergic to anything resembling algebraic equations: such readers
may wish to click <a href="http://www.lesession.co.uk/pf/abc_notation_part2.htm#chords">here</a> now.</p>

<p>For more complicated notation of irregular
rhythmic episodes, abc allows for the use of the form</p>

<p>(<em>p</em>:<em>q</em>:<em>r</em></p>

<p>where</p>

<p><em>p</em> = the number of notes to be put
into time <em>q</em><br>
<em>q</em> = the time that <em>p </em>notes will be played in<br>
<em>r</em> = the number of notes to continue to do this action
for.</p>

<p>If <em>q</em> is not specified, it defaults
to 3 in compound time signatures and 2 in simple time signatures.
If <em>r</em> is not specified, it is taken to be the same as <em>p</em>.</p>

<p>This comes into play when notating notes of
different lengths within a tuplet eg</p>

<p>(3:2:2G4c2</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>(3:2:4G2A2Bc</p>

<p>and explains exactly what is going on in
situations such as</p>

<p>(3D2E2F2</p>

<p>- which is the same as putting</p>

<p>(3:2:3D2E2F2</p>

page</a></p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="chords"></a>Chords and Unisons</h3>

<p>Chords for guitars etc. can be found <a href="http://www.lesession.co.uk/pf/abc_notation_part2.htm#guitar">here</a>.</p>

<p>Chords within a melody, eg what classical
Western notation would show as multiple note heads on a single
stem, are shown in abc by enclosing the notes in square brackets
[ ]. There should be no spaces within the chord, length and pitch
modifiers can be included as required, and it is a convention to
state the notes of the chord in ascending order, eg</p>

<p>[Acea]</p>

<p>Chords can be arranged to form beamed
groups using spaces in the same way that individual notes are, eg</p>

<p>[GB][Ac] [B2d2] | [Bd][Ac] [G2B2]</p>

<p>The syntax for chords can be used to notate
more than one part in a single line of music - and in that case,
or in cases where two strings play the same note, it will
occasionally be necessary to notate a unison (eg both parts
playing a note of the same pitch and length). Software which
generates classical Western notation from abc will show unisons
eg<br>
[AA]<br>
as a note with both an upwards and a downwards stem.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lesession.co.uk/pf/abc_notation_part2.htm#top">Back to the top of the
page</a></p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="guitar"></a>Guitar chords</h3>

<p>Chords for accompanying instruments can be
shown in abc using double quotation marks " " eg</p>

<p>"Dm7"</p>

<p>The chord should appear before the first
note of the section of melody which the chord applies to, eg</p>

<p>"G"GB d2 | "D"DF A2</p>

<p>Chords take the format </p>

<table border="1">
    <tbody><tr>
        <td><em>note</em></td>
        <td><em>accidental</em></td>
        <td><em>type</em></td>
        <td><em>/ bass</em></td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>where</p>

<table border="1">
    <tbody><tr>
        <td>note</td>
        <td>A to G</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>accidental</td>
        <td># or b</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>type</td>
        <td>m, min, maj, sus, dim, +, 7, 9,
        11,#5, etc. etc</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>/ bass</td>
        <td>Bass note</td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p><em>accidental</em>, <em>type</em>, and / <em>bass</em>
are all optional.</p>

<p>You may occasionally come across an abc
file which uses the older abc style of denoting guitar chords, by
surrounding them with addition signs +Gm+ : more recent versions
of the abc specification specify the use of the "Gm"
style, so please do your chords like that.</p>

page</a></p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="lines"></a>Line ends and line
breaks</h3>

<p>In software which generates standard
Western notation from abc, the general rule is that one line of
abc will generate one line of
tadpoles-hanging-on-five-barred-gates.</p>

<p>Most packages will however 'wrap' the staff
of music onto the next line if your printed page width isn't big
enough.</p>

<p>To try to insist that two lines of abc
notation make one line of tadpoles, put a back slash <br>
\ <br>
at the end of the first line. Again, this may be over-ridden by
the software if you run out of space.</p>

<p>The other common symbol often seen used in
marking line breaks is an exclamation mark <br>
!<br>
placed at the end of a line of abc, to force the software
generating the standard Western notation to start a new line.
This is specific to one particular piece of abc software and is
not actually a formal part of the abc notation specification, but
(as so many abc files are generated in this particular software
package, ABC2Win) it is worth mentioning here. </p>

<h3><a name="fiddle"></a>Fiddle bowing marks</h3>

<p>Up-bow and down-bow marks for fiddlers can
be indicated by the letters u (up-bow) and v (down-bow), eg</p>

<p>v_Au=Bv^c</p>

<h3><a name="I&#39;m_French_why_do_you_think_I&#39;ve_got_this_outrageous"></a>Accents</h3>

<p>If you want to indicate that a particular
note should be played <em>staccato</em>, place a dot . before the
note, eg</p>

<p>.A</p>

<p>or even</p>

<p>.G.A._B.c .d2.e.d.^c</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lesession.co.uk/pf/abc_notation_part2.htm#top">Back to the top of the
page</a></p>

<p>There are proposals to extend the
range of accents available in abc : <a href="http://www.lesession.co.uk/pf/abc_extensions.htm#go_away_arthur_you_silly_king">click here for further details</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="header"></a>Information fields in
the tune header</h2>

<p>As seen in the first part of this tutorial,
the tune header contains a number of fields giving information
about the tune such as title, rhythm, key signature, etc. The
introductory tutorial mentioned the fields which must be shown in
the tune header, and also described some of the optional
information fields which are most commonly used.</p>

<p>The abc specification allows for many more
optional descriptive or information fields to be used in the tune
header - the full list is :</p>

<p>To repeat a small part of the first part of
this tutorial:</p>

<p>The X: index, T: title, M: meter, L:
default note length, and K: key field are obligatory : the others
are optional.</p>

<p>The fields usually occur in the following
order:<br>
X: <br>
T:<br>
M:<br>
L:<br>
[optional fields] <br>
K:</p>

<p>And immediately following the K: field on
the next line is the <strong>body</strong> of the tune, eg the
representation of the notes of the melody.</p>

<h3><a name="parts"></a>Parts </h3>

<p>This section deals with the parts of a melody, eg the introduction, A part, B part etc.
There are proposals to extend the syntax available in abc for notating parts as in part-singing, harmony parts etc.,
eg multiple voices : <a href="http://www.lesession.co.uk/pf/abc_extensions.htm#voices">click
here for further details</a>.</p>

<p>Parts can be indicated in the P: field in
the tune header to indicate what order the parts of the tune are
played in for both human and computer players, eg</p>

<p>P:AABCBD</p>

<p>The body of the tune will then contain
corresponding markers at the start of each part eg</p>

<p>P:A</p>

<p>Note that the declaration in the header,
showing the order of parts, can be abbreviated using brackets eg</p>

<p>AABBAABB</p>

<p>can be shown as</p>

<p>2(2A2B)</p>

<p>and dots can be added to improve
legibility, eg</p>

<p>2(2A2B).3(CD).2(2A2B).CD</p>

<h3><a name="words"></a>Song words </h3>

<p>The W: field (upper case W) in the header
can be used as many times as needed to record the entire words of
the song as a block of text eg</p>

<p>W:How much is that doggie in the window<br>
W:The one with the waggly tail?<br>
W:How much is that doggie in the window<br>
W:I do hope that doggie's for sale<br>
(etc. etc.)</p>

<p>This form of notating the song words will
produce the words as a single text block below the tune, if the
abc file is fed into a software package which generates standard
Western notation.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lesession.co.uk/pf/abc_notation_part2.htm#top">Back to the top of the
page</a></p>

<p>There are proposals to extend the
syntax available in abc for notating song words : <a href="http://www.lesession.co.uk/pf/abc_extensions.htm#words">click
here for further details</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="comments"></a>Comments in an abc
file</h3>

<p>To include comments, notes, anecdotes,
copyright notices etc. in your abc file (as opposed to using the
N: and H: fields in a particular tune), use a percentage % symbol
eg</p>

<p>%This file was downloaded from<br>
%http://www.lesession.co.uk</p>

<p>a % at the start, or in the middle of, a
line will cause everything to the right of the % symbol to be
treated as comments by both human and computer abc readers.</p>

<p>Note that some software packages take
advantage of this syntax to place software-specific messages in
the body of an abc tune - these can usually be distinguished by
the human eye as they start with a double percentage sign eg %%.</p>

<h2>Putting it all together</h2>

<h3><a name="order"></a>1) The order of
symbols</h3>

<p>If (for the sake of argument) you want to
use many or all of the features available for use in the tune
body on one note, which order should they appear in?</p>

<p>The order is :</p>

<table border="1">
    <tbody><tr>
        <td>Guitar chords</td>
        <td>accents</td>
        <td>accidental</td>
        <td>note</td>
        <td>octave marker</td>
        <td>note length modifier</td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The abc specification gives</p>

<p>"Gm7"v.=G,2</p>

<p>as an example, and I think that states the
point perfectly.</p>

<h3><a name="software"></a>Comparison of the
various software packages</h3>

<p>Having read my abc tutorials, people
occasionally email me to ask "What is the best abc software
package?"</p>

<p>And my answer is always a clear and
unequivocal</p>

<p>"Well ... that depends really".</p>

<p>The abc notation system is, of course, not
tied to computer software at all - many a perfectly good piece of
abc notation has been scribbled down on the back of a beermat in
the middle of a crowded music session, using nothing more hi-tech
than a pen borrowed off of a friend. My objective in writing
these tutorials has been to teach how abc itself works.</p>

<p>The best abc software package is the one
which works best for you. What <strong>that is</strong> depends
on all sorts of factors, such as -</p>

<ul>
    <li>What computer operating system you are
        using.</li>
    <li>How much you like typing the abc in
        directly, how much you prefer to have it all done for you
        by icons and menus, how much you value the freedom to do
        both.</li>
    <li>What features you find essential in a
        notation programme, and what features you find peripheral
        or downright irritating.</li>
    <li>What you want to do with your abc
        files once you've got them.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the great joys of abc is that the
majority of the software packages are shareware, so you can try
before you buy. Once you decide on the package or packages that
work for you, please register them - nobody is getting rich from
supporting abc, none of the packages are expensive, and all
software registrations are encouragement to the author(s) for
past efforts, present value, and further developments.</p>

<p>There is a list of software packages for abc at the abc home page, <a href="http://www.abcnotation.org.uk/" target="new">http://www.abcnotation.org.uk</a>.
  Frank Nordberg has also compiled a comparative guide to abc software at <a href="http://www.musicaviva.com/abc/abcapp/index.tpl" target="new">http://www.musicaviva.com/abc/abcapp/index.tpl</a></p>

<h3><a name="ta"></a>Thanks and other credits</h3>

<p>Thanks for this second page of the tutorial
go to Lynn Chivers and Richard Peach of the abc-enabled ceilidh
band Olio for alpha-testing: a part of the credit for the
accuracy of this tutorial go to them, whilst responsibility is
all mine for all remaining examples of poor speling, erroneous
explanation and sheer wilful obscurity.</p>

<p>For more thanks, conditions of use, and an explanation as to
why I wrote all this in the first place, please <a href="http://www.lesession.co.uk/pf/abc_notation.htm#feedback">see the
thanks on the introductory page</a>.</p>
