	<h3><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h3>

	<p>Abc notation is a simple but powerful ASCII
	musical notation format. Devised by Chris Walshaw, abc is widely
	used for the notating and distribution of tunes, particularly on
	the internet. Very popular in traditional music circles, it is
	also gaining in popularity in early music.</p>

	<p>A tune notated in abc can be played
	directly from the notation, or many software packages exist which
	can convert abc notation into MIDI, produce sheet music, play the
	file through the computer speaker, etc.</p>

	<p>Abc is not reliant on the user even having
	a computer, or on a computer having any specific music hardware
	and software. It is platform and OS independent, and is a very
	efficient way of storing and distributing tunes and collections
	of tunes. John Adams of the
	<a href="http://www.village-music-project.org.uk/" target="new">Village Music Project</a>, at the end of
	a talk at Sidmouth Festival in 1999, distributed over 1000 tunes
	on a single floppy disk!</p>

	<p>This tutorial does not claim to be
	authoritative or even complete in its coverage of the abc
	standard. It is intended to be an introduction (albeit a reasonably comprehensive one),
	and sufficiently detailed to enable you to read and write abc files.</p>

	<p>I would of course be extremely indebted to
	anyone who points out any errors of fact or interpretation in
	this tutorial.</p>

	<p>The tutorial assumes you possess basic
	knowledge of how 'standard' Western musical notation works in
	terms of note names and lengths, the concept of a tune having a
	key, etc.</p>

	<p>For further information on abc, the various
	software packages available, and links to other abc sites and
	tune collections, go to the abc home page at <a href="http://www.abcnotation.org.uk/" target="new">
	http://www.abcnotation.org.uk</a>.</p>

	<h3><a name="notes"></a>The Notes</h3>

	<p>Middle C is notated as <br>
	C<br>
	The D immediately above middle C is notated as <br>
	D<br>
	The E above that is notated as <br>
	E<br>
	And so on up the scale.</p>

	<p>Starting at middle C, the notes in that
	octave are shown as</p>

	<p>CDEFGAB</p>

	<p>The next note up is a C again – but to
	show it is in the higher octave, that C is shown in lowercase as <br>
	c<br>
	So a full one-octave C major scale from middle C is</p>

	<p>CDEFGABc</p>

	<p>So going from middle C to the B one octave
	and seven notes above that is</p>

	<p>CDEFGABcdefgab</p>

	<p>And we’re back at yet another C note.
	The next octave up is shown by an apostrophe immediately after
	the note name, like <br>
	c’</p>

	<p>So our scale now runs two octaves from
	middle C:</p>

	<p>CDEFGABcdefgabc’</p>

	<p>And using the apostrophe to denote the
	upper octave we can extend our scale further :</p>

	<p>CDEFGABcdefgabc’d’e’f’g’a’b’</p>

	<p>But what about the B immediately <i>below</i>
	middle C? That octave is shown by a comma immediately following
	the note name, eg <br>
	B,</p>

	<a name="#noterange"></a>
	<p>We now have four octaves at our disposal,
	which is more than enough for our purposes of notating
	traditional music:</p>

	<p>
	C,D,E,F,G,A,B,CDEFGABcdefgabc'd'e'f'g'a'b'
	</p>

	<p>but note that the range can be extended
	further by adding more commas or apostrophes. A picture paints a thousand words, so
	here is a picture:</p>

	<h3><a name="l_field"></a>Notes of different
	lengths (the L: field)</h3>

	<p>Abc allows you to set the ‘default
	note length’ for each tune. This is set (as a fraction) in
	the <a href="http://www.lesession.co.uk/pf/abc_notation.htm#altogether">tune header</a> in the L: field.</p>

	<p>The following table shows the most common
	default note lengths for traditional music, with the equivalent
	terms from ‘standard’ music notation. This will
	hopefully give you the idea.</p>

	<table border="1" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="1" width="568">
	    <tbody><tr>
	        <td valign="top" width="33%"><b>Default
	        note length</b></td>
	        <td valign="top" width="33%"><b>‘English’
	        terminology</b></td>
	        <td valign="top" width="33%"><b>‘American’
	        terminology</b></td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	        <td>1/2</td>
	        <td>Minim</td>
	        <td>Half note</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	        <td valign="top" width="33%">1/4</td>
	        <td valign="top" width="33%">Crotchet</td>
	        <td valign="top" width="33%">Quarter
	        note</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	        <td valign="top" width="33%">1/8</td>
	        <td valign="top" width="33%">Quaver</td>
	        <td valign="top" width="33%">Eighth
	        note</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	        <td valign="top" width="33%">1/16</td>
	        <td valign="top" width="33%">Semi-quaver</td>
	        <td valign="top" width="33%">Sixteenth
	        note</td>
	    </tr>
	</tbody></table>

	<p>So a tune where the default note length is
	a quaver, or eighth note, would have</p>

	<p>L:1/8</p>

	<p>in its header.</p>

	<h4>Why is this important?</h4>

	<p>Because the notes in tunes aren’t
	always all the same length. By setting a default note length you
	are setting the value of the most common note length in your
	tune.</p>

	<p>So to return to our C major scale</p>

	<p>CDEFGABcdefgabc'</p>

	<p>If this had a default note length of 1/8,
	eg the L: field was shown as L:1/8, our scale as shown is a scale
	of quavers:<br>
	<img src="./LeSession  Steve Mansfield's Abc music tutorial_files/scale_q.jpg" alt="Scale as quavers" width="240" height="76"></p>

	<p>. If the default length was ¼, eg L:1/4,
	the <u>same notation of the same scale</u> is now a scale of
	crotchets:<br>
	<img src="./LeSession  Steve Mansfield's Abc music tutorial_files/scale_c.jpg" alt="Scale as crotchets" width="245" height="67"></p>

	<p>But, as mentioned a bit earlier, the notes
	in tunes aren’t always all the same length.</p>

	<h4>What happens if notes are shorter than the
	default note length?</h4>

	<p>If the particular note you are notating
	(which, for the sake of brevity, I will from now on call <i>the
	current note</i>) is half the length of the default note length,
	it is shown with a forward slash immediately after it, eg<br>
	C/<br>
	This can also be written as C/2 if you wish.</p>

	<p>If the current note is a quarter of the
	default note length, it is shown like so : C/4</p>

	<p>If the current note is an eighth of the
	default note length, it is shown like so : C/8</p>

	<p>Other fractions (/3, /5, /7, /16 etc.) are
	also legal.</p>

	<h4>What happens if notes are longer than the
	default note length?</h4>

	<p>If the current note is twice the default
	note length, it is shown like so : C2</p>

	<p>If the current note is four times the
	default note length, it is shown like so : C4</p>

	<p>Other multiples (3, 5, 7, 8 etc.) are also
	legal.</p>

	<h4>Remember :</h4>

	<p>The length of any particular note is always
	calculated according to the default note length of the tune.</p>

	<h4>A quick word about hornpipes</h4>

	<p>The hornpipe rhythm is useful to illustrate
	one more way abc allows the notation of notes of differing
	length.</p>

	<p>A hornpipe could be notated with a default
	note length of 1/16 like so :</p>

	<p>L:1/16<br>
	D3EF3G</p>

	<p>An easier way is to set the default note
	length to 1/8 and use the greater than &gt; symbol :</p>

	<p>L:1/8<br>
	D&gt;EF&gt;G</p>

	<p>The greater than (and less than) sign can
	be used wherever groups of dotted notes are found.</p>

	<p>The &lt; symbol has the same effect in the
	other direction, eg shortening the first note and lengthening the
	second, as found in strathspeys etc.</p>

	<h4>One last thing about default note lengths</h4>

	<p>Some ‘standard’ default note
	lengths for common types of tunes</p>

	<table border="1" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="1" width="568">
	    <tbody><tr>
	        <td valign="top" width="18%">Jig</td>
	        <td valign="top" width="82%">1/8</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	        <td valign="top" width="18%">Reel</td>
	        <td valign="top" width="82%">1/8</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	        <td valign="top" width="18%">Schottische</td>
	        <td valign="top" width="82%">1/8</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	        <td valign="top" width="18%">Waltz</td>
	        <td valign="top" width="82%">1/4</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	        <td valign="top" width="18%">Polka</td>
	        <td valign="top" width="82%">1/8</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	        <td valign="top" width="18%">Bourree</td>
	        <td valign="top" width="82%">1/8</td>
	    </tr>
	</tbody></table>

	<p>However according to the particular tune there is nothing to stop you using
	  a different default note length if it makes the notation easier to read. </p>
	<p>An L: field can be placed in the middle of a tune to denote a change of default
	  note length - see the <a href="http://www.lesession.co.uk/pf/abc_notation.htm#midtune_changes">Mid-tune changes selection</a>
	  below.</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.lesession.co.uk/pf/abc_notation.htm#top">Back to the top of the
	page</a></p>

	<hr>

	<h3><a name="rests"></a>Rests</h3>

	<p>Rests are indicated by the (lower case)
	letter z. The length of rest is set exactly the same way as the
	length of note is, eg<br>
	z4<br>
	</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.lesession.co.uk/pf/abc_notation.htm#top">Back to the top of the
	page</a> </p>

	<hr>

	<h3><a name="sharps"></a>Sharps, flats and
	naturals</h3>

	<p>So far all examples have been in the key of
	C. Not every tune is in C however, and some tunes confuse matters
	even further by having accidentals in them.</p>

	<p>To sharpen a note precede it with the
	circumflex or caret ^ <br>
	^c</p>

	<p>To flatten a note precede it with an
	underscore _<br>
	_B</p>

	<p>Double sharps are shown as ^^ and double
	flats as __</p>

	<p>To naturalise (?) a note precede it with an
	equals sign =<br>
	=c</p>

	<p>So a scale of G major could be notated as</p>

	<p>GABcde^fg</p>

	<p>And a scale of G minor as</p>

	<p>GA_Bcd_efg</p>

	<p>However : just as standard Western musical
	notation has the key signature, so that the player automatically
	knows to (for example) play all Fs as F# in the key of G : the
	same thing exists in abc, with the K: field.</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.lesession.co.uk/pf/abc_notation.htm#top">Back to the top of the
	page</a></p>

	<hr>

	<h3><a name="k_field"></a>Key signatures (the
	K: field)</h3>

	<p>The key signature is specified by the K:
	field eg<br>
	K:G</p>

	<p>So our G major scale can now be written as <br>
	K:G<br>
	GABcdefg</p>

	<p>And our G minor scale as <br>
	K:Gm<br>
	GABcdefg</p>

	<p>Major keys are assumed, but can be
	specified by maj eg <br>
	K:Gmaj</p>

	<p>Minor keys are shown by m or min, eg <br>
	K:Gm <br>
	or<br>
	K:Gmin.</p>

	<p>In the key signature field sharps are noted
	by the hash character # and flats by the letter b, eg</p>

	<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="1">
	    <tbody><tr>
	        <td>B flat :</td>
	        <td>K:Bb</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	        <td>C sharp :</td>
	        <td>K:C#</td>
	    </tr>
	</tbody></table>

	<p>Modal keys (the Lydian, Ionian, Mixolydian,
	Dorian, Aeolian, Phrygian and Locrian modes) can all be specified
	by adding the first 3 letters of the mode eg<br>
	K: G mix<br>
	or<br>
	K:Gmix</p>

	<p>Highland Bagpipe notation is also catered
	for : <br>
	K:HP <br>
	puts no key signature on the music but implies the bagpipe scale,
	while<br>
	K:Hp<br>
	puts F sharp, C sharp and G natural.</p>

	<p>More complex key signatures can also be expressed by global accidentals : as
	  one example, where would the abc notation of Swedish and Macedonian tunes be
	  without such signatures as <br>
	  K:A =C<br>
	  (eg A major with C natural, or to put it another way, a key signature of F sharp
	  and G sharp).</p>
	<p>A K: field can be placed in the middle of a tune to denote a change of key
	  - see the <a href="http://www.lesession.co.uk/pf/abc_notation.htm#midtune_changes">Mid-tune changes selection</a> below.</p>

	<p>Summary :</p>

	page</a></p>

	<hr>

	<h3><a name="m_field"></a>Time signatures (the
	M: field) and the rhythm R: field</h3>

	<p>Time signatures, or meters, like default
	note lengths, are shown as fractions in the M: field, eg:</p>

	<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
	    <tbody><tr>
	        <td>Jig</td>
	        <td>M:6/8</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	        <td>Reel</td>
	        <td>M:4/4</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
	        <td>Waltz</td>
	        <td>M:3/4</td>
	    </tr>
	</tbody></table>

	<p>And so forth. Common time is shown as C,
	and cut time as C| (the letter C followed by the pipe symbol).</p>

	<p>Abc also includes a rhythm field, R:, which
	is used for cataloguing and sorting collections of abc tunes:
	this is entirely free text (although there are obvious
	‘standard’ entries eg R:reel, R:jig, R:schottische).</p>

	<p>An M: field can be placed in the middle of a tune to denote a change of meter
	  - see the <a href="http://www.lesession.co.uk/pf/abc_notation.htm#midtune_changes">Mid-tune changes selection</a> below.</p>

	<h4>Summary :</h4>

	<p>G major scale in jig time in quavers:</p>

	<p>M:6/8<br>

	<h4></h4>
	<hr>
	<h3><a name="midtune_changes" id="midtune_changes"></a>Mid-tune changes of key,
	  time etc.</h3>
	<p>The L: note length field, the M: meter field, the K: key signature field and
	  the Q: tempo field can all be inserted in the middle of a tune to indicate a
	  key change. Strictly speaking this should be on a new line eg to play a G major
	  scale ‘up’ and a G minor scale ‘down’ again,</p>
	<p>K:G<br>
	  GABcdefg <br>
	  K:Gm<br>
	  gfedcBAG</p>
	<p>but most software packages will allow the use of [ ] square brackets eg</p>
	<p>K:G<br>
	  GABcdefg [K:Gm] gfedcBAG.</p>
	<p>If you want to change two fields at once, either put them on two new lines
	  like this - </p>
	<p>K:G<br>
	  GABcdefg |<br>
	  M:6/8 <br>
	  K:Gm<br>
	  gfe dcB | AGB FED |</p>
	<p>or put them both in the square brackets in the middle of the line like so :</p>
	<p>K:G<br>
	  GABcdefg | [M:6/8 K:Gm] gfe dcB | AGB FED |</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.lesession.co.uk/pf/abc_notation.htm#top">Back to the top of the page</a></p>
	<h4></h4>

	<hr>

	<h3><a name="barlines"></a>Barlines and spaces</h3>

	<p>Barlines are denoted by the pipe symbol |.
	Our G major scale in jig time immediately becomes more readable :</p>

	<p>M:6/8<br>
	L:1/8<br>
	R:Jig<br>
	K:G<br>
	GABcde|fgfedc|BAG</p>

	<p>A double bar is shown by ||, and by using the square bracket symbol as |] (thin-thick)
	  and [| (thick-thin). Repeats are dealt with soon.</p>

	<p>To make the notation even more readable
	spaces can be inserted to separate groups of notes :</p>

	<p>M:6/8<br>
	L:1/8<br>
	R:Jig<br>
	K:Gm<br>
	GAB cde|fgf edc|BAG</p>

	<p>Spaces are also used within the melody, and by the various
	software packages which convert abc into standard notation, to
	group notes. The spacing of abc notation will tend to
	mirror the grouping which would be used in standard notation.
	Spaces may also be inserted at the start
	and / or end of bars to make the abc more readable.
	As an example, I find something like </p>

	<p> G | GAG GAG | c2G EFG | A2F DEF | GEC C2E | </p>

	<p>easier on the eye than</p>

	<p> G|GAG GAG|c2G EFG|A2F DEF|GEC C2E| </p>

	page</a></p>

	<hr>

	<h3><a name="repeats"></a>Repeats</h3>

	<p>Repeats bring the colon : into action. The
	start of a repeated section is shown by <br>
	|:<br>
	and the end of a repeated section by<br>
	:|</p>

	<p>Where the end of one repeated section, and
	the beginning of the next, coincide,<br>
	:||:<br>
	is technically correct, but this is usually shown without the
	pipe symbols eg <br>
	::</p>

	<p>Numbered and alternate repeats are indicated by [1 and [2 (etc.). Where the
	  start of a section co-incides with a barline the [ symbol may be omitted, eg
	</p>
	<p>DE FF |[1 GA Bc :|[2 GA BG ||</p>
	<p>can also be written as </p>
	<p>DE FF |1 GA Bc :|2 GA BG ||</p>
	<p>However if a repeat section does <strong><em>not</em></strong> coincide with
	  a barline, always use the [ symbol instead of inserting an extra | .</p>
	<p>Note that there can be no blank space between the barline and the number -
	  eg [1 and |1 are acceptable, whereas [ 1 and | 1 are not.</p>

	<h3><a name="t_field"></a>The title field (T:)
	and the index field (X:)</h3>

	<p>Nearly every tune has a title, and one
	should always be included for identification purposes in tune
	lists, even if the exact title is not known. The title is
	indicated by the T: field eg</p>

	<p>T:Ballydesmond polka</p>

	<p>A tune may have more than one title - in
	this case just add a second, third, etc. T: field (each on a new
	line) and enter the alternative title(s) in there.</p>

	<p>There is one more field to introduce at this stage : the X: index field. </p>
	<p>The X: field is primarily for computers' benefit, as they (computers) have
	  much more trouble than human beings in telling where one tune stops and the
	  next starts. Many software packages therefore rely on the X: field to signify
	  the start of a tune, even if there's only one tune in a file, and a blank line,
	  followed by an X: field, delimits one tune from the next. It is therefore good
	  practise to include an X: field at the head of your abc tune(s).</p>
	<p>The X: field is put on the first line of the notation of a tune, and takes
	  the form </p>
	<p>X:&lt;number&gt;</p>
	<p>It is good practise (but not absolutely essential) for the X: field to be incremental,
	  eg the first tune in a file is X:1, the second tune in the file is X:2, etc.</p>

	<h3><a name="tempo"></a>The tempo field (Q:)</h3>

	<p>The tempo of a tune is shown in the Q:
	field, giving either the human or software musician a speed
	indication, eg<br>
	Q:120<br>
	indicates the tempo as 120 notes of the default note length per
	minute.</p>

	<p>Q:1/8 = 120<br>
	  can also be used, to specify in this example that the tune goes at the rate
	  of 120 1/8 notes per minute, regardless of the default note length.</p>
	<p>A T: field can be placed in the middle of a tune to denote a change of tempo
	  - see the <a href="http://www.lesession.co.uk/pf/abc_notation.htm#midtune_changes">Mid-tune changes selection</a> above.</p>

	<h3><a name="optionals"></a>More (optional)
	fields : composer, source, origin, notes</h3>

	<p>The <strong>composer</strong> of a tune is
	recorded in the C: field, eg</p>

	<p>C:Frederic Paris</p>

	<p>The <strong>source</strong> of a tune is
	recorded in the S: field, eg</p>

	<p>S:Dave Collinge, at Preston EuroJam
	November 1998</p>

	<p>The geographical <strong>origin</strong> is
	recorded in the O: field, eg</p>

	<p>O:Massif Central</p>

	<p>Textual <strong>notes</strong> on the tune
	are stored in the N: field, eg</p>

	<p>N:Long rambling note about this tune going
	into great detail, which can<br>
	N: be split across several lines using multiple N: fields</p>

	<p>The identity of the <strong>transcriber</strong>
	or source of the <strong>transcription</strong> is recorded in
	the Z: field, eg</p>

	<p>Z:Steve Mansfield 12/11/1999</p>

	<p>The above are the most common fields
	encountered in abc files, but there are many more (W: for song
	words, B: for book, etc.) See <a href="http://www.lesession.co.uk/pf/abc_notation.htm#omit">things I've not mentioned</a>
	for full details.</p>

	<h3><a name="altogether"></a>Putting it all
	together</h3>

	<p>An abc notation of a tune has two sections,
	the ‘header’ and the ‘body’.</p>

	<p><b>The header </b>contains the various
	information fields (index, title, rhythm, key, meter, etc.). A
	few important rules :</p>

	<blockquote>
	    <ul>
	        <li>The first field of a tune is
	            always the X: field</li>
	        <li>Each field in the header occurs on
	            a new line </li>
	        <li>The last field in the header,
	            immediately before the notation of the melody itself,
	            is always the K: field</li>
	        <li>The X: index, T: title, M: meter,
	            L: default note length, and K: key field are
	            obligatory : the others are optional.</li>
	        <li>The fields usually occur in the
	            following order:<br>
	            X: <br>
	            T:<br>
	            M:<br>
	            L:<br>
	            [optional fields] <br>
	            K:</li>
	    </ul>
	</blockquote>

	<p>As stated, immediately following the K:
	field on the next line is the <strong>body</strong> of the tune,
	eg the representation of the notes of the melody. </p>

	<p>If there is a subsequent tune in the abc
	file there will be at least one blank line after the end of the
	first melody, then the start of the second tune is denoted by the
	X: field of the next tune. There should be no blank lines <em>within</em>
	a tune - whilst human abc readers can cope with this, computers
	cannot.</p>

	<h3><a name="omit"></a>Things I’ve not
	mentioned</h3>

	<p>Abc notation allows for many other nuances
	of melodies to be recorded:</p>

	<p>Ornaments and grace notes, slurs, ties,
	triplets and other ets, chords and unisons, guitar chords, line
	ends and line breaks, fiddle bowing marks, accents, more
	information fields in the tune header, parts, song words, and
	comments in an abc file.</p>

	<p>These topics, and quite possibly more, are
	now all covered in ... <a href="http://www.lesession.co.uk/pf/abc_notation_part2.htm">
	part two of this tutorial</a>.</p>
